 * Name: stm32_spl06_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   Initialize and register's stm32f411-minimum's spl06. The wiring
 *   isn't configurable, but we use macros anyway because some of the
 *   values are referred to in more than one place. And also, because
 *   that's generally what NuttX does.
 *
 *   In particular, the slave-select pin is defined by us, but
 *   controlled elsewhere as part of the SPI machinery. This is an odd
 *   thing in our case because nothing else is using the SPI port, but
 *   that's not the general presentation so I'm staying consistent
 *   with the pattern.
 * 
 *                                      add by herc  2021.10.26
 *                                            copy from stm32_mpu60x0.h
